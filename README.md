# Retail Reimagined: The Forecasting Framework

Unlock the future of retail with **Retail Reimagined**, a sales forecasting project utilizing the Rossmann Store Sales dataset. By combining data cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling, this project decodes retail sales trends to deliver actionable insights.

---

## **Project Overview**
This project is an exploration of data-driven approaches to forecasting daily sales for retail stores. Key highlights include:
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values and merging multiple datasets.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating insightful variables like `CompetitionOpenDuration` and temporal features.
- **Predictive Models**: Implementing Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Lasso Regression.
- **Evaluation**: Comparing model performance using RMSE and visualizations of predicted vs. actual sales.

---

## **Key Features**
- üìä **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover meaningful trends.
- üîç **Feature Engineering**: Innovative variables to capture promotional effects and competition dynamics.
- ü§ñ **Robust Modeling**: Use of diverse predictive techniques for accurate forecasting.
- üìà **Insights Delivery**: Highlighting actionable business strategies based on findings.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Languages**: R
- **Libraries**: 
  - `dplyr`, `ggplot2` for data manipulation and visualization.
  - `randomForest`, `glmnet` for modeling.
  - `caret` for evaluation and cross-validation.

---

## **Results**
The models implemented were evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The project reveals:
- Key drivers of sales trends.
- Comparative performance of models like Random Forest and Lasso Regression.
- Insights into the impact of promotions and competition.
